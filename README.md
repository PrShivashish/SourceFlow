#  Source Flow - A Web Extension

Turn your entire codebase into a perfectly formatted prompt for any LLM, right from your browser.

In the age of AI, your codebase is a conversation. Source Flow is the ultimate universal translator, letting you brief your AI assistant on a complete project without the hassle of manual file handling or context limits.

## ✨ What It Does

Manually copying and pasting files into an AI prompt is slow, inefficient, and quickly hits token limits. Source Flow solves this by intelligently reading your project, filtering out the noise, and packaging everything into a single, focused brief for your AI.

It runs as a Chrome Extension in your browser's side panel, integrating seamlessly into your workflow.

## 🛠️ For Developers (Contributing & Running Locally)

If you want to contribute to the project or run it from the source code, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.x or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
